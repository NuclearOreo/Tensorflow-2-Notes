# My Note on Tensorflow

Getting familiar with Tensorflow 2 by in trying to create 
bunch of neural networks for classic problems. Bacis regression, classification
convolutional and recurrent network. Then hopefully move on to GANs, autoencoder
and harder problems

## Python environment and packages  I'm using

```
python 3.7.2
tensorflow 2.0.0-alpha0 
jupyter
matplotlib
numpy
pandas
```
